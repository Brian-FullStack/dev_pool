# Dev Pool
Dev Pool is a pool of resources for developers. It is a site where developers can explore assets that might come in useful throughout their career. Dev Pool can also be a great place to share useful assets with others in the community.

## Inspiration
Inspiration for this project came from scrolling through instagram and seeing posts sucdh as "5 resources every developer needs to know" or "Top 10 extensions to improve your coding!"

After creating a file on my computer to save all these assets, I thought having a site where developers can pool their useful resources and share them with the wider community would be a better and very much in the spirit of the dev community.
