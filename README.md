# Dev Pool
![Device Responsiveness](static/images/README-images/am-i-responsive-dev-pool.png)

Dev Pool is a pool of resources for developers. It is a site where developers can explore assets that might come in useful throughout their career. Dev Pool can also be a great place to share useful assets with others in the community.

## Inspiration
Inspiration for this project came from scrolling through instagram and seeing posts sucdh as "5 resources every developer needs to know" or "Top 10 extensions to improve your coding!"

After creating a file on my computer to save all these assets, I thought having a site where developers can pool their useful resources and share them with the wider community would be a better and very much in the spirit of the dev community.

I used [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) for many of the UI components in this project such as cards, responsive navigation, modals and forms. This has been my first time using Materialize and overall I enjoyed how responsive its componants are and its ease of use.

## Colors
The colors in this site simple but wanted to use colors I thought developers might find familiar. I chose a dark grey similiar to that of GitHub or VSCode. I chose a blue/green which I thought felt kinda techy. I chose the off white to reduce eye fatigue for users. I chose the red to signify negitive user actions such as deleting.

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to help pick the color pallet for this site.

| Color Use  | HEX Code  | Color  |
|------------|-----------|--------|
|Buttons & Borders | #6DD3CE | ![#6DD3CE](https://via.placeholder.com/15/6DD3CE/000000?text=+) |
|Cards, Forms, Hero Container & Dark Headers/Text | #2D2327 | ![#2D2327](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2D2327/000000?text=+) |
|Background & Light Headers/Text | #F0E2E7 | ![#F0E2E7](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F0E2E7/000000?text=+) |
|Delete Buttons & Borders | #d71f53 | ![#d71f53](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d71f53/000000?text=+) |

## Images
The only image used in development of this site is a placeholder image which is put in place when users choose not to upload an image/logo of the asset that they are sharing. I created this placeholder image using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
